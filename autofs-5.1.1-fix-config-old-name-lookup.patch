autofs-5.1.1 - fix config old name lookup

From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

There are three cases needed to handle configuration name lookup.

First there's the configuration key name, the name match is case
insensitive so the recent case change isn't a seperate case.

But the much older configuration key names that began with "DEFAULT_"
need special handling.

There are two cases that need to be covered:
1) an old name is given but a new name needs to be located.
2) a new name is given but an old name needs to be located.

Only 1) is currently covered, so fix that in conf_lookup().
