autofs-5.0.8 - check for existing offset mount before mounting

From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

The change that introduced the miscellaneous device for autofs
mount control removed a mount point mounted check from the
mount_autofs_offset() function for when the miscellaneous
device is not used.

But a subsequent change that enabled limited update of the exports
of a hosts mount needed that check. Without it a second occurance
of the offset (corresponding to an export) could be mounted upon
a map re-read.
