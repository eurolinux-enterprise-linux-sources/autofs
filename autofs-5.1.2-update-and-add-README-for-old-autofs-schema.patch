autofs-5.1.2 - update and add README for old autofs schema

From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

The distribution file samples/autofs.schema is very old and is
incorrect.

This schema was added to the discribution long ago when it was
not clear what schema to use for Linux autofs information.

The schema was updated (at least to have consistent OIDs) somewhere
along the line but the autofs distribution copy was never updated.
The schema has now been updated in autofs but it is not recommended
for use as the schema for autofs map information.

The rfc2307 or, preferably the, rfc2307bis schema is the recommened
schema to use.

+autofs schema
+=============
+
+The distribution file samples/autofs.schema is very old and is
+incorrect.
+
+This schema was added to the discribution long ago when it was
+not clear what schema to use for Linux autofs information.
+
+The schema was corrected somewhere along the line but the autofs
+distribution copy was never updated. The schema has now been
+updated but it is not recommended for use as the schema for autofs
+map information.
+
+The rfc2307 or, preferably the, rfc2307bis schema is the recommened
+schema to use.
+
+Note: Upstream the schema file was updated but in RHEL-6 the old
+schema file has been left in place and the updated schema file
+add as autofs.schema.new.
