autofs-5.0.6 - fix segmentation fault in do_remount_indirect()

From: Leonardo Chiquitto <leonardo.lists@gmail.com>

In some rare circumstance, it's possible that automount will crash
on startup while trying to reconnect to a "half-broken" NFS mount
point.

The segmentation fault happens because we're not testing scandir()'s
return value in do_remount_indirect():

lib/mounts.c:
1210       i = j = scandir(buf, &de2, 0, alphasort);
1211       while (i--)
1212         free(de2[i]);

So, if scandir() returns -1, it will try to free de2[-1], de2[-2], etc.

Here's the call trace, for reference:

Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

1212                    free(de2[i]);
(gdb) print j
$1 = -1
(gdb) print de2
$3 = (struct dirent **) 0x0

Suggested fix:

Check scandir() return value

In some rare circumstance, it's possible that automount will crash
on startup while trying to reconnect to a "half-broken" NFS mount
point.
